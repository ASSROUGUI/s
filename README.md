Ember.js is an open source, free JavaScript client-side framework used for developing web applications. It allows building client side JavaScript applications by providing a complete solution which contains data management and an application flow.

The original name of Ember.js was SproutCore MVC framework.


its framework for
ambitious web developers.



**why use it ?
Ember.js is an open source JavaScript framework under MIT license.

It provides the new binding syntax using the HTMLBars template engine which is a superset of the Handerlbars templating engine.

It provides the Glimmer rendering engine to increase the rendering speed.

It provides the Command Line Interface utility that integrates Ember patterns into development process and focuses easily on the developer productivity.

It supports data binding to create the link between two properties and when one property changes, the other property will get upgraded with the new value.

**Features of Ember.js:

Ember.js is used for creating reusable and maintainable JavaScript web applications.

Ember.js has HTML and CSS at the core of the development model.

It provides the instance initializers.

The routes are core features of the Ember.js which are used for managing the URL's.

Ember.js provides Ember Inspector tool for debugging Ember applications.

Ember.js uses templates that help to automatically update the model, if the content of applications gets changed.



**Basic concepts:


Ember consists of five key concepts:

Routes
In Ember, the state of an application is represented by a URL. Each URL has a corresponding route object that controls what is visible to the user.
Models
Every route has an associated model, containing the data associated with the current state of the application.
While one can use jQuery to load JSON objects from a server and use those objects as models, most applications use a model library such as Ember Data to handle this.
Templates
Templates are used to build the application's HTML and are written with the HTMLBars templating language. (HTMLBars is a variation of Handlebars that builds DOM elements rather than a String.)
Components
A component is a custom HTML tag. Behavior is implemented using JavaScript and its appearance is defined using HTMLBars templates. Components "own" their data. They can also be nested and can communicate with their parent components through actions (events). Other component libraries such as Polymer can also be used with Ember.
Services
Services are just singleton objects to hold long-lived data such as user sessions.
Ember also provides dependency injection, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, and automatically-updating templates.
